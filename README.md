[00:03.98] 今宵も 限りなく
[00:06.07] 大胆に でも巧妙に 運命に
[00:09.93] 映し出すまさに影法師
[00:12.57] 暴走し その代償に 高揚し
[00:19.07] 
[00:15.83] それが燃料に 炎上し
[00:18.37] 燃え盛れ 上等し やった通り
[00:21.20] 人生の敗北と勝利
[00:23.97] 誰のせいにしないように
[00:29.47] 
[00:25.73] 初めて見た父の背中
[00:27.87] 俺の場合はそこに絵が描いてた
[00:30.56] 何の偏見もない
[00:31.81] しかし俺は一点の墨も入れるつもりはない
[00:41.31] 
[00:35.30] 何かのせいにしても
[00:36.63] 何も救っちゃくれやしないさ
[00:38.42] その千羽鶴じゃ
[00:41.92] 
[00:40.38] We are the rising sun
[00:42.93] We are the supernova
[00:45.33] We are the audacious
[00:47.94] Oh, don't think, sing
[00:58.44] 
[00:50.34] We are the rising sun
[00:52.90] We are the supernova
[00:55.50] We are the audacious
[00:57.90] Oh, don't think, sing
[01:08.40] 
[01:01.87] 今宵も 限りなく
[01:04.57] 大胆に でも巧妙に 運命に
[01:07.94] 映し出すまさに影法師
[01:10.64] 暴走し その代償に 高揚し
[01:17.14] 
[01:13.74] それが燃料に 炎上し
[01:16.43] 燃え盛れ 上等し やった通り
[01:19.27] 人生の敗北と勝利
[01:21.89] 誰のせいにしないように
[01:27.39] 
[01:24.00] きっと俺は 本当は性別関係なく
[01:27.14] 人を愛し 付き合うこともできる
[01:29.70] 何の抵抗もない
[01:31.08] そんな俺を独りにする世界や
[01:37.58] 
[01:33.36] 何かのせいにしても
[01:34.77] 何も救っちゃくれやしないさ
[01:36.57] その千羽鶴じゃ

[02:10.86] Best ever
[02:13.09] Brighter than ever
[02:16.46] まだ追いつける keep getting than ever
[02:20.29] アイディアで戦う clever
[02:23.18] 不本意に慣れるな never
[02:25.35] More than ever
[02:32.35]
